# KMeans-Predictive-Modeling
K-Means Clustering is a Machine Learning Algorithm which creates a model based on the nearest-neighbour-choice. </br>

The model in this repository has been implemented by k-means classification which predics the favourite sport in a state(in India).</br>

### Use
An attempt to make the code as readable as possible has been made. <br>
You can modify the code to create your own k-means classification.</br>
**e.g.** Instead of *states*(a list used in the *fav_sport.py* file), you can use languages which people speak throughout the world.</br>
Feel free to reach out for any suggestions or help!
